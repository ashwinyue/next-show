I have created a detailed Frontend Design Document in Chinese at `docs/FRONTEND_DESIGN.md`.

This document outlines:
1.  **Design Philosophy**: "Refined Industrial" style.
2.  **Tech Stack**: Vite, React, TypeScript, Zustand, Shadcn UI.
3.  **Directory Structure**: Detailed breakdown of the `web/` folder.
4.  **Feature Modules**: Detailed specs for Layout, Chat (with SSE & Thinking UI), Agent Management, and Knowledge Base.
5.  **Interaction & API**: Error handling, Responsive design, and Proxy setup.

I am now ready to proceed with the implementation starting with initializing the project structure.
